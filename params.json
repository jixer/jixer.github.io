My core focus are is connected systems / EAI, but I also dable when I can in the mobile and web spaces.  \r\n\r\nI try to blog when I can.  My blog site can be found here: [BloggedByChris.com](http://bloggedbychris.com)\r\n\r\nYou can reach me on Twitter using the handle [@myerscj](http://twitter.com/myerscj)\r\n\r\n# Jixer.GitHub.io Tools\r\nI will use this site as a sandbox for small proof of concepts and tools.  The following tools can be found on this site:\r\n\r\n## Site Search Tool\r\nThe [Site Search Tool](apps/search) can be used to run Google searches that are confined to specific sites.  For example, you may want to search DateTime, but only across msdn.microsoft.com.  As you may already know, this can be done by including `site:msdn.microsoft.com` in your Google search.  The object of this tool is to wrap and simplify that exact feature in the Google search API.\r\n\r\nThe tool also allows you to easily add and remove domains that you wish to filter on.\r\n\r\nThe tool was built using AngularJS.  All of the source code can be found by navigating to the app/search section of this site's GitHub page (click the \"View on GitHub\" link in the top right corner).\r\n\r\n**_Disclaimer: Providers are stored in your browser's local storage.  If you clear local storage or attempt to access this page from a different browser or computer, please note that your saved providers will not be maintained._**\r\n\r\n## Maps\r\nThe [Maps Tool](apps/maps) is mainly just a resource for me.  I use it to create detailed maps for rural areas in Arizona.  Feel free to use it if you're interested in finding fun places to camp in AZ.",
