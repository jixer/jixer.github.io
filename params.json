{"name":"Jixer.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Site Search Tool\r\nThe Site Search Tool can be used to run Google searches that are confined to specific sites.  For example, you may want to search DateTime, but only across msdn.microsoft.com.  As you may already know, this can be done by including `site:msdn.microsoft.com` in your Google search.  The object of this tool is to wrap and simplify that exact feature in the Google search API.\r\n\r\nThe tool also allows you to easily add and remove domains that you wish to filter on.\r\n\r\nThe tool was built using AngularJS.  All of the source code can be found by navigating to the app/search section of this site's GitHub page (click the \"View on GitHub\" link in the top right corner).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
